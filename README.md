# instance-generator

REQreate is a tool developed in Python and is designed with the main objective to generate instances for on-demand transportation problems. It has a goal to assist researchers in testing their optimization algorithms by providing an easy and efficient way to create instances of distinct types and sizes. We developed the tool to be flexible and generic as possible, so, by simply providing a configuration file in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, it is possible to generate instances for a diversity of problems. Such problems include the Dial-a-Ride Problem (DARP), On-demand Bus Routing Problem (ODBRP), School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP), and many others. Considering that new problems emerge constantly, and absence of test instances is an issue, the tool has the potential to generate instances that could be applied to those novel problems by providing the necessary parameters.
